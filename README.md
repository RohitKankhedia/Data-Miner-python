# Data Miner (ver 1.0) - Converting and Consolidating unstructured data into structure data.

Present days most of the companies are working on Data Lake concept to consolidate there existing data bases which are residing in there sub units or department or  process.



In term of consolidation most of technique include SAS , macro or automation,RPA 

where SAS & RPA  is not being used by every company so there are cases where automation ,macro are now being written by developer to consolidate all data but again that time consuming .



In order to simplify all aspect and work i have build a solution to eliminate time consuming macro writing (automation) for consolidation and refining all unstructured data at no cost because it is absolutely free...



*Here unstructured data mean is where you don`t know where is the header in the whole worksheet or any type of database but what you know is the name of column name or data schema.  





Today on 10th Dec 2018 i am launching this tool in public which i have build this tool on python which again platform independent, so go ahead and try it and let me know if you require any amendment as per your requirement.



For any update or queries please email of comment....
